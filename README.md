# Car Wash Recommendation App

## Project Description

The Car Wash Recommendation App helps users decide on the best day to wash their car based on weather data. Using data from a public weather API, this app considers factors like rainfall, temperature, and wind speed to give users a recommendation on the most suitable day to wash their car within a selected time range.

### Features

* Weather Forecast Analysis: Evaluates upcoming weather conditions such as rain probability, temperature, and wind.
* City Selection: Allows users to select their city.
* Time Range Selection: Users can specify the start and end dates for the recommendation.
* Best Day Suggestion: Provides a clear suggestion for the optimal day to wash a car based on the chosen conditions.

### Future Enhancements
I planned to add a feature that would suggest the best day to wash the car if the user doesn't have a specific day in mind. However, due to some technical challenges, this feature is not yet ready.

### Tech Stack

* Frontend: React with JavaScript/TypeScript
* UI Library: Material-UI (The app uses MUI components primarily for layout and basic styling, but more focus was placed on functionality than on design.)
* API: Public weather API for fetching forecast data
* State Management: React hooks or context
